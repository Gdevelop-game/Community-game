# GDevelop Open Game  

This Repository is an Attempt to create a GTA-like game using **GDevelop**. The name is likely to change later on. Moereover,
we are likely to work in teams rather than individually so your performance/contribution will be a major factor.

### I am pumped for this, how can I contribute?

* Firstly thanks a lot for your interest in this project! This is not an easy task and hence we would love to have you onboard with us.
* For starters, you can join our [discord chanel](https://discord.gg/xKCf8et), you will be guided on how to contribute to the game.
